## Morse Code Translator

A web page that translates text to morse code and morse code to text.

## MVP

-   Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code
-   Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

    -   translate their English text into Morse Code
    -   Morse Code into English text

-   Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)
-   Make sure to keep your pure functions separated from the JS DOM interaction code.
-   Add unit tests for each of the pure function that your translator uses (each function should have at least 4 tests, think of edge cases, wrong inputs, etc ...)
