### MVP

-   Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code
-   Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

    -   translate their English text into Morse Code
    -   Morse Code into English text

-   Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)
-   Make sure to keep your pure functions separated from the JS DOM interaction code.
